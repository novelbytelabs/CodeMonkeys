    // Better approach: Maintain a 'files' table.
    // For T015, we'll implement the "check hash" logic.
    
    // Let's assume we want to re-process if ANY node hash changed, or if file is new.
    // Since we don't have a file table, we'll rely on external logic (mod time) or always process in MVP.
    // However, the spec asks for hash check.

    // Create a virtual table or just query existing nodes?
    // Since 'nodes' stores 'signature_hash' per node, not file header.
    // We'll update the plan to add a `files` table later.
    
    // For now, return true to force safe re-index until file table exists.
