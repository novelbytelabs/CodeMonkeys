# ArqonShip Constitution

**Version**: 1.6.0  
**Ratification Date**: 2025-12-13  
**Last Amended**: 2025-12-19  

This document defines the **non-negotiable principles** that govern how ArqonShip is designed, evolved, and maintained.

It exists to protect ArqonShip from accidental bloat, regression, silent breakage, and “clever” shortcuts that erode trust.

If a decision conflicts with this constitution, **the decision is wrong**.

> **Spec Kit Note:** This constitution is the hard sandbox for all `/speckit.*` commands.  
> Specs, plans, and tasks **must not** violate the constraints in Sections II–XIX.

# ULTIMATE INTEGRITY COVENANT

This constitution is a **hard constraint** on all engineering work. It exists to prevent the failure modes that destroy real systems:

- “Happy path” engineering that collapses under real inputs
- Pseudocode / placeholders / stubs presented as completion
- Tests that “check boxes” but don’t model production reality
- Fake evidence (invented logs, benchmarks, screenshots, coverage, results)
- Unnamed technical debt that silently becomes permanent
- Silent failure handling and silent security degradation
- Undocumented complexity and unreadable “clever” code
- Non-reproducible builds, non-deterministic behavior, and flaky verification
- Work products that are narrative-only, vague, or unverifiable

If a decision conflicts with this covenant, **the decision is wrong**.

---

### A. The Only Acceptable Meaning of “DONE” (The 8-Pillar Standard)

A change is **NOT DONE** until all eight pillars are true:

1. Implementation  
   - Real code exists (not pseudocode). It compiles, runs, and handles edge cases.  
   - Invalid states are rejected; invariants are enforced.  
   - Failure behavior is explicit: timeouts, retries, backpressure, cancellation, and partial failures are defined.

2. Verification  
   - Automated tests cover normal + failure + adversarial + concurrency/ordering behavior.  
   - Tests model production complexity, not toy inputs.  
   - Where appropriate: property-based tests, fuzzing, chaos/fault injection, and regression tests exist.

3. Documentation  
   - In-repo docs explain: architecture, usage, invariants, data contracts, and “what can go wrong.”  
   - Operational caveats are explicit: limits, failure modes, rollback strategy, and safety constraints.  
   - Every public behavior change updates docs and/or changelog.

4. Evidence  
   - Reproducible proof exists (CI artifacts, logs, traces, coverage reports, benchmarks).  
   - Evidence is not implied; it is attached or linkable to a specific commit/run.  
   - If there is no evidence, the claim is false.

5. Traceability  
   - Each requirement / acceptance criterion maps to:
     - code locations,
     - test locations,
     - documentation locations,
     - evidence artifacts.
   - No orphan requirements. No orphan code. No untested requirements.

6. Operational Readiness  
   - Safe defaults, explicit configuration validation, and clear failure signals exist.  
   - Observability exists: structured logs + metrics + tracing (or an equivalent breadcrumb system).  
   - Rollout/rollback exists where relevant; migrations are reversible or explicitly irreversible.

7. Security & Safety Readiness  
   - Threat assumptions are stated. Privilege boundaries are validated.  
   - Secrets are not logged; sensitive data is redacted.  
   - Fail-closed behavior is defined for safety/security modules (no silent “allow”).

8. Task Completeness  
   - Work is decomposed into a concrete task list (not vague bullets).  
   - Each task includes acceptance criteria, a test hook, and an evidence hook.  
   - If a task is not done, the work is not done.

Rule: Declaring “done” without satisfying every pillar is deception.

---

### B. The Anti-Half-Ass Rules (Merge-Blocking by Definition)

#### B1. No Pseudocode-as-Deliverable
- Pseudocode may exist only as clearly labeled design notes.  
- Pseudocode cannot be the “solution,” cannot substitute for tests, and cannot be used to claim completion.

#### B2. No Placeholders / No Stubs / No “Later”
Forbidden in production paths:
- `TODO`, `FIXME`, `pass`, `todo!()`, empty handlers, commented-out behavior, “mock later,” “hardening later,” “edge cases later.”
If incomplete behavior must exist temporarily, it must:
- be feature-flagged OFF by default,
- be isolated so it cannot affect production behavior,
- have a `TD-###` record with TTL (see Debt Policy).

#### B3. No Fake Data, No Toy Inputs, No Lazy Synthetics
- Tests and examples must use production-like complexity: realistic IDs, nested payloads, boundary sizes, malformed variants, weird unicode/whitespace, and adversarial inputs.
- Ban list (unless the test is explicitly about these literals): `foo`, `bar`, `user_1`, `test123`, “hello world.”

#### B4. No Happy Path Testing
For any externally coupled feature (filesystem, subprocesses, network, storage, package backends), tests must cover:
- timeouts, retries, partial failures, malformed responses, permission failures, cancellation, overload/backpressure, and out-of-order/duplicate events where relevant.

#### B5. No Silent Failures
- Swallowing errors is forbidden. Every error must be handled, logged with context, or propagated.
- “Fallback to success” behavior without explicit documentation and tests is forbidden.

#### B6. Warnings Are Errors
- Compiler, linter, formatter, typechecker warnings block merge. “It builds on my machine” is irrelevant.

#### B7. No Unbounded Risk
- Unbounded queues, unbounded memory growth, unbounded metric cardinality, unbounded retries, and unbounded timeouts are forbidden.
- If something can grow, it must have a cap. If it can retry, it must have a budget. If it can wait, it must have a timeout.

---

### C. Technical Debt Policy (Zero Debt Unless Named + Owned + Expiring)

Technical debt is **forbidden by default**. If debt must exist, it must be explicit, bounded, and temporary.

Debt is valid only if it is recorded as `TD-###` and includes:
- owner,
- scope and blast radius,
- why it exists,
- the exact exit criteria (“debt is removed when…”),
- remediation plan,
- hard TTL date,
- tests guarding the boundary so the debt cannot silently expand.

Rules:
- Debt without TTL is invalid.
- Debt past TTL blocks merge/release.
- “We’ll fix later” is not a plan.
- “Temporary” code paths must have an explicit sunset mechanism.

---

### D. SDD + TDD Contract (Professional Standard)

#### D1. Specification-Driven Design Requirements (for non-trivial changes)
A valid spec includes:
- intent and non-goals,
- acceptance criteria (falsifiable),
- invariants (must-always-be-true),
- failure modes and expected behavior under each,
- compatibility rules (protocol/API/schema expectations),
- performance envelope and resource bounds (when relevant),
- security/privacy assumptions and constraints,
- operational concerns (observability, rollout/rollback, migration notes).

If the spec is ambiguous, the first task is to remove ambiguity by producing falsifiable criteria.

#### D2. Test-Driven Development Requirements
- Tests define behavior before/with implementation (TDD by default).
- Refactors require existing tests protecting behavior.
- Every bug fix includes a regression test that fails pre-fix and passes post-fix.
- Flaky tests are critical bugs; they must be fixed, not ignored.

---

### E. Verification Constitution (Realism + Adversarial + Failure-First)

Required test categories (as applicable):
- unit tests for pure logic (fast, no external deps),
- integration tests for boundaries and real dependency interactions,
- property-based tests for parsers/validators/protocol/config boundaries,
- fuzz tests for user-controlled input surfaces,
- concurrency/ordering tests for races, duplicates, replays, idempotency,
- chaos/fault injection for externally coupled behaviors,
- performance regression checks for hot paths or stated latency budgets.

Verification must explicitly test:
- malformed inputs,
- partial reads/writes,
- timeout handling,
- retry policy and idempotency guarantees,
- permission boundaries,
- overload/backpressure behavior,
- deterministic ordering assumptions (or explicit non-guarantees).

---

### F. The Claim Ledger (Mandatory Honesty)

Any claim like “works,” “done,” “fixed,” “secure,” “fast,” “compatible,” “production-ready” must be labeled:

- Observed: executed + evidence attached
- Derived: reasoned + assumptions listed + risks stated
- Unverified: not tested + the exact minimal experiment provided

Presenting Derived/Unverified claims as Observed is lying.

---

### G. Minimum Acceptable Deliverable (Non-Negotiable Output Shape)

Any non-trivial work product must include all of:
- a concrete task list with acceptance criteria per task,
- a file-level plan (what files change/add/remove),
- implementation code,
- tests (including failure/adversarial coverage where relevant),
- documentation updates,
- an Evidence Pack (defined in the footer).

If any part is incomplete, it must be explicitly labeled Unverified and paired with the shortest experiment that would verify it.

### H. Default Principles

If a situation, decision, or design choice is not explicitly covered by this Constitution, the default principle is to:
- **Adopt the most stringent, resilient, and transparent posture.**
- **Enforce the primacy of operational integrity, unambiguous intent, and disciplined scaling.**
- **Treat unresolved ambiguity as a Constitutional void, demanding immediate and formal amendment.**

# I. Vision and Scope

## 1. The Vision

**ArqonShip is a probe-gated optimization engine for time-to-target—and a runtime control primitive for microsecond-latency adaptation.**

It is built to be clearly competitive for two product-aligned use cases:

1. **Fast simulation tuning:** expensive evaluations (milliseconds to seconds) where reaching a useful threshold quickly matters.
2. **Sklearn-style model tuning:** moderate-cost evaluations where optimizer overhead is material and "good-enough quickly" often wins.

**Control Primitive Posture:** Once the decision loop operates at microseconds, optimization is treated as a feedback control primitive. The system's job is to steer toward homeostasis under changing conditions (drift, load, hardware throttling) using bounded changes. This is achieved through:

* **Discovery Offline, Adaptation Online:** Offline discovery (Tier Ω) generates and evaluates candidates; online adaptation (Tier 2) selects among approved variants and proposes bounded deltas.
* **Law Control:** Online tuning of "physics knobs" (diffusion, noise, decay, damping, constraint weights) within allowlisted parameters and strict safety envelopes.
* **Microsecond Latency:** ArqonShip is designed for 1–10ms decision latency, enabling embedding in live control loops without blocking the dataplane.

## 2. The Scope

To achieve this vision, we must be ruthless about what ArqonShip **is** and what it **is not**.

### 2.1 In Scope (The Core Product)

ArqonShip is **probe-gated optimization** and **runtime adaptation**. It is responsible for:

* **The Probe Phase:** Deterministic sampling to gather an initial signal and candidates.
* **The Classification Phase:** A fixed-size test that labels the landscape (e.g., structured vs chaotic) and produces a score.
* **The Mode Selection Phase:** Selecting a refinement strategy based on the classification result.
* **The Refinement Phase:** Executing the chosen optimizer within the remaining budget.
* **Audit Artifacts:** Schema-versioned run artifacts sufficient for replay and accountability.
* **Systems/Infrastructure Knobs:** Tuning database parameters, connection pools, cache sizes, and runtime configurations in bounded, safe, auditable ways.
* **Runtime Law Tuning:** Adjusting simulation/physics parameters (e.g., diffusion rates, constraint weights) within safety envelopes during online operation.

### 2.2 Out of Scope (The Boundaries)

ArqonShip is **not**:

* **A general-purpose ML training framework.** It tunes; it does not train end-to-end pipelines.
* **A distributed execution platform.** It may integrate with external evaluators, but it does not provide a cluster runtime.
* **A “guaranteed best on all objectives” optimizer.** Claims must be scoped to the benchmark suite and use cases.

## 3. The Strategic Horizon

We define evolution in three distinct epochs. Engineering decisions must align with the current epoch while reserving capacity for the next.

* **Epoch 1: The Foundation (Deterministic probe-gated core).**
    * *Focus:* determinism, bounded overhead, artifact auditability, and time-to-target benchmarking.
    * *Goal:* be measurably competitive on the two target use cases.
* **Epoch 2: The Platform (Composable strategies).**
    * *Focus:* pluggable backends, richer classification signals, replay tooling.
    * *Goal:* support multiple strategies without breaking contracts.
* **Epoch 3: The Research Frontier (Optional).**
    * *Focus:* experimental samplers, meta-controllers, and novel structural probes.
    * *Goal:* enable experimentation without contaminating production defaults.

# II. Core Principles

This section defines the engineering laws that govern ArqonShip. These are not guidelines; they are constraints. Code that violates these principles will be rejected during Review.

### 1. Architectural Invariance (The Gate Pattern)

The system is composed of four non-negotiable phases. **Strict adherence** to the **probe-gated pipeline** is required to prevent coupling and ensure reproducibility.

**The Phases:**

* **Probe:** deterministic sampling; gathers initial candidates and signal.
* **Classify:** fixed-size classification; emits score + label.
* **Select:** chooses refinement mode based on classification.
* **Refine:** executes the chosen optimizer within the remaining budget.

**The Bypass Ban:**

No phase may be skipped because it is “convenient.”

* **Forbidden:** Selecting a refinement mode without running classification.
* **Forbidden:** Adding hidden objective calls that do not count against budget.
* **Forbidden:** Silent fallbacks that change mode/behavior without artifacts and tests.

### 2. Statelessness & State Explicit-ness

To ensure runs can be reproduced and audited, we adhere to a **Stateless Where Possible** philosophy.

* **Run Ephemerality:** Any process must be able to crash and restart without corrupting an ongoing run artifact.
* **State Explicitness:** All non-trivial solver state must be explicit, serializable, and captured in artifacts if it affects decisions.
* **Seed Sovereignty:** All randomness must come from explicit seeds; hidden global RNG use is forbidden.

### 3. Contract Sovereignty (Typed Inputs, Versioned Artifacts)

We enforce a strict separation between machine-stable contracts and human-readable debugging.

**Typed Contracts:**

Configuration and run inputs must be expressed in typed structures. The config contract is the single source of truth for defaults and validation.

**Artifact Reservations:**

Artifacts are schema-versioned and must be stable and replayable. Logs are diagnostics and must not be required for replay.

### 4. Future-Proofing Hooks (The Moonshot Mandate)

To enable future experimentation without requiring a rewrite, v1.0 must reserve capacity for:

* **Backend Hook:** Ability to select a refinement backend via a stable interface.
* **Classifier Hook:** Ability to extend classification signals while preserving the fixed-size gating contract.
* **Objective Guard Hook:** Ability to wrap objectives for timeouts/redaction without changing the solver core.
* **Replay Hook:** Ability to replay decisions from artifacts.

### 5. Semantic Versioning & Compatibility

We adhere to strict Semantic Versioning regarding the **Public API** and **Artifact Schemas**.

**Versioning Rules:**

* **MAJOR:** Breaking changes to solver public API, artifact schema, or core behavior.
* **MINOR:** New modes, additive fields (optional), new telemetry, or non-breaking enhancements.
* **PATCH:** Bug fixes, performance improvements, and clarifications.

**Stealth Ban:**

There shall be no "stealth" breaking changes in MINOR or PATCH versions. Ever.

### 6. Data Isolation & Privacy (The Bulkhead)

Optimization objectives may embed sensitive information.

* **Isolation:** Objective payloads are treated as sensitive by default.
* **Redaction:** Logs/artifacts must not leak secrets or tenant data.
* **Sharing Safety:** Artifacts intended for sharing must support redaction without breaking replayability guarantees.

### 7. Security by Design

Security is a baseline constraint, not a feature.

* **Zero Trust:** The solver does not trust the objective; it validates inputs and guards execution.
* **Fail Closed:** If a safety/guard module fails, times out, or crashes, the run is failed explicitly. It is never "allowed by default."
* **Secure Defaults:** Unsafe execution modes must be opt-in and auditable.

### 8. Programmable Safety (Guards)

We reject hardcoded, silent safety logic. Safety requirements vary by environment.

* **Guard Middleware:** Objective guards (timeouts, resource caps, redaction) must be composable.
* **Fail Closed Mandate:** If a guard times out, crashes, or returns an error, execution is blocked and surfaced.
* **Bounded Execution:** All guards must have strict, non-negotiable limits.

### 9. Run-as-Artifact (The Capsule Principle)

Runs are not just ephemeral computations. They must produce replayable artifacts.

* **Digital DNA:** The system is optimized to transport the *potential* (seed + config + bounds + decisions), not just the result.
* **Replayability:** A run can be reconstructed from the artifact plus the objective.

### 10. Delta-First Evidence

Computation cost and audit burden scale with **change ($\Delta$)**.

* **Diff over Snapshot:** Prefer per-eval traces and incremental evidence over opaque summaries.
* **Causal Integrity:** Decisions and their inputs must be recorded in order.

### 11. Circuit-First Benchmarking

Benchmarks are declarative.

* **Bench Suites are Circuits:** Benchmark suites define objectives, budgets, targets, and seed suites as configuration.
* **Decoupled Objectives:** Objectives remain oblivious to optimizer internals.

### 12. Probe Algorithm Specification

Production probes MUST use mathematically validated low-discrepancy sequences.

* **Default Algorithm:** Kronecker/Weyl sequences with irrational slopes derived from prime square roots (e.g., `PrimeSqrtSlopesRotProbe`).
* **Banned Patterns:** The `p/1000` heuristic and rational-slope sequences are forbidden due to collision and striping artifacts.
* **Anytime Property:** Probe quality of first K samples MUST NOT depend on total N.
* **Randomization:** Cranley-Patterson (CP) shifts are the approved QMC randomization mechanism. Global RNG injection into base sequences is forbidden.
* **Robustness Hedge:** A configurable `random_spice_ratio` (default 10%) of uniform random points hedges against multimodal fragility.

### 13. Dimension Type Contract

Optimization geometry must respect dimension semantics.

| Scale | Arithmetic | Contract |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Linear** | Euclidean | Standard distance, mean |
| **Log** | Log-space Euclidean | Transform → operate → inverse |
| **Periodic** | Circular/Toroidal | `wrap01`, `diff01`, `circular_mean01` |

* **NM on Periodic:** Reflection, expansion, and contraction operations MUST use circular arithmetic (wrap at bounds).
* **Probe on Periodic:** Samples MUST respect toroidal topology (no edge bias).
* **Canonical Helpers:** `wrap01(x)`, `diff01(a,b)`, `circular_mean01(values)` are the canonical implementations.

### 14. Multi-Start Strategy Contract

Refinement strategies may use parallel starts for diversity.

* **K-Parallel Starts:** Multi-start strategies run K independent NM instances from diverse seed points.
* **Diversity Seeding:** Farthest-point selection from top-K×(dim+1) pool. Clustered seeding is forbidden.
* **Triage Budget:** Each start gets a bounded triage budget before commitment decisions.
* **Stall Detection:** Stall threshold triggers start rotation; unbounded stalling is forbidden.

### 15. Parallel Sharding Contract

Probes must support stateless parallel execution.

* **Stateless Sharding:** A probe MUST produce identical samples for (seed, index) regardless of worker count.
* **Collision-Free:** Disjoint index ranges MUST produce disjoint samples.
* **SDK Parity:** `ArqonProbe` (Python) MUST expose identical behavior to Rust core.
* **Verification:** Bitwise hash of sorted sample coordinates MUST match single-worker vs multi-worker configurations.

### 16. Adaptive Engine Specification

Online parameter adaptation MUST use validated optimization algorithms with mandatory safety layers.

| Aspect | Requirement |
|:---|:---|
| **Default Algorithm** | SPSA (Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation) — 2 evaluations per gradient estimate, regardless of dimension |
| **Banned Patterns** | Finite-difference gradients (O(n) evals), unbounded learning rates, global step sizes without decay |
| **Decay Schedule** | `a_k = a₀/(k+1+A)^α` and `c_k = c₀/(k+1)^γ` with standard exponents (α=0.602, γ=0.101) |
| **Perturbation** | ±1 Bernoulli (symmetric) ONLY; Gaussian perturbations are forbidden due to heavy tails |
| **Determinism** | Same (seed, iteration) MUST produce identical perturbation vectors |
| **State Machine** | Ready → WaitingPlus → WaitingMinus → Ready (strict 2-eval cycle) |

* **Canonical Implementation:** `Spsa` struct with `ChaCha8Rng` for deterministic perturbations.
* **Budget Enforcement:** Each adaptation cycle MUST complete within `budget_us` microseconds.

### 17. Safety Executor Contract

All configuration updates MUST pass through `SafetyExecutor`. Direct writes to live config are **forbidden**.

| Guardrail | Default | Contract |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `max_delta_per_step` | 0.1 (10%) | Absolute parameter change cap per update |
| `max_updates_per_second` | 10.0 | Rate limit for stability |
| `min_interval_us` | 100,000 (100ms) | Minimum cooldown between updates |

**Violation Types (MUST block, not just log):**

| Violation | Trigger |
|:---|:---|
| `DeltaTooLarge` | Change exceeds `max_delta_per_step` |
| `RateLimitExceeded` | Updates exceed `max_updates_per_second` |
| `OutOfBounds` | Proposed value outside domain bounds |
| `UnknownParameter` | Parameter not in allowlist (allowlist pattern mandatory) |

* **Rollback Requirement:** Every config swap MUST preserve a baseline for rollback. Rollback-free execution is forbidden.
* **Fail Closed:** If `validate_delta()` returns `Err(Violation)`, the update is rejected entirely—partial application is forbidden.

### 18. Atomic Configuration Contract

Configuration swaps MUST be atomic with no torn reads in the control loop.

| Requirement | Implementation |
|:---|:---|
| **Atomicity** | Arc-swap semantics with RwLock or true atomic primitives |
| **Generation Counter** | Monotonically increasing `u64`, observable by readers |
| **Zero-Allocation Hot Path** | `snapshot()` MUST NOT allocate (cheap Arc clone only) |
| **No Mutex Contention** | Writers MUST NOT block readers in steady state |

* **Canonical Types:** `AtomicConfig` (container) and `ConfigSnapshot` (immutable view with params + generation).
* **Thread Safety:** All methods on `AtomicConfig` MUST be `Send + Sync`.

### 19. Telemetry Digest Contract

Streaming telemetry MUST be compact, fixed-schema, and lock-free in the push path.

| Field | Type | Required |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `timestamp_us` | u64 | ✓ |
| `objective_value` | f64 | ✓ |
| `latency_p99_us` | Option<u64> | — |
| `throughput_rps` | Option<f64> | — |
| `error_rate` | Option<f64> | — |
| `constraint_margin` | Option<f64> | — |

* **Ring Buffer:** Fixed-capacity `TelemetryRingBuffer`, overflow evicts oldest. No dynamic allocation in `push()`.
* **Size Budget:** `TelemetryDigest` MUST fit in ≤128 bytes for cache efficiency.
* **Minimal Helpers:** `TelemetryDigest::objective(value)` and `TelemetryDigest::with_timestamp(ts, value)` are the canonical constructors.

### 20. Tier Architecture Model

ArqonShip operates with a strict three-tier architecture. These tiers are **non-optional** and govern all runtime behavior.

| Tier | Role | Responsibilities | Prohibitions |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Tier 1 (Safe Executor)** | Sole actuator | AtomicConfig swap, allowlist enforcement, bounds checking, max-delta limits, rate limits, rollback/snapback, audit emission | Cannot skip guardrails; cannot apply unevaluated proposals |
| **Tier 2 (Adaptive Engine)** | Proposal generator | Reads telemetry digests, proposes bounded deltas, selects among approved variants | **Cannot mutate production state directly**; must be deterministic and time-budgeted |
| **Tier Ω (Offline Discovery)** | Candidate generator | Runs continuously or periodically, generates new law families / architecture candidates, outputs diagnostic artifacts | **Never in the hot path**; outputs are candidates only, not direct actions |

**Tier 1 Contract:**
* The only component allowed to apply changes to production state.
* Enforces allowlist (unknown parameters → rejection), bounds (out-of-bounds → rejection), max-delta (per-step change cap), rate limits, and rollback requirements.
* Must be deterministic: same (config, proposal) → same outcome.

**Tier 2 Contract:**
* Reads compact telemetry digests from Tier 1's observation surface.
* Proposes deltas or selects among approved variants.
* All proposals go through Tier 1's guardrails before application.
* Must complete within `budget_us` microseconds.

**Tier Ω Contract:**
* Runs in background / batch mode, never blocking the control loop.
* Outputs candidates that must pass offline evaluation and promotion gates before entering the Approved Variant Catalog.
* Outputs are labeled "diagnostic" or "candidate," never "decision."

### 21. Merge-Blocking Tier Rules

The following are **merge-blocking rules**. Pull requests violating these MUST NOT be merged.

| Rule | Violation |
|:---|:---|
| Tier-2 cannot mutate production state | Any code path where Tier 2 writes to AtomicConfig without going through Tier 1 |
| Tier-1 is sole actuator | Any direct config mutation outside SafetyExecutor |
| Tier-Ω outputs are candidates only | Any code path where Ω output is applied to production without promotion gate |
| Tier boundaries are explicit | Tier logic mixed without clear module separation |

### 22. Variant Catalog Contract

The **Approved Variant Catalog** is the safety boundary for discrete configuration choices.

**Lifecycle States:**

| State | Description | Online Eligible |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Draft** | Initial candidate, not yet evaluated | ❌ |
| **Evaluated** | Offline evaluation completed, results documented | ❌ |
| **Approved** | Passed promotion gate, eligible for production selection | ✅ |
| **Promoted** | Currently active in production selection pool | ✅ |
| **Archived** | Retired from active use, retained for replay | ❌ |

**Promotion Requirements:**
* Offline evaluation evidence (benchmark results, safety metrics)
* Documented constraints (bounds, applicability conditions)
* Rollback plan (how to revert if issues arise)
* Evidence pack attached to promotion record

**Selection Rules:**
* Runtime MUST only select among `Approved` or `Promoted` variants.
* `Draft` and `Evaluated` variants are NEVER eligible for online selection.
* Online "NAS-like" behavior is selection among approved variants, not live invention.

**Schema Requirements:**
* Variants must have unique IDs, version numbers, and creation timestamps.
* Variants must be tied to reproducible artifacts and replay seeds.
* Variant transitions must be audited (who, when, why).

### 23. Safety Semantics for Co-evolving Laws

**Clarification:** "Laws" and "physics" in this constitution refer to simulation/runtime update-rule parameters (e.g., diffusion rates, noise schedules, constraint weights), NOT real-world physical laws.

**Explicit Invariants:**

| Invariant | Requirement |
|:---|:---|
| No unbounded exploration online | All online search is bounded by approved catalog and delta limits |
| No uncontrolled oscillation | Anti-thrashing rules required: cooldowns, hysteresis, confidence gating |
| Homeostasis recovery | Must be demonstrable with shock tests (inject perturbation → observe recovery) |

**Homeostatic Mode Caching:**
* The runtime MAY cache "homeostatic modes" (stable configurations that achieve target SLOs).
* Cached modes enable fast re-entry without re-optimization.
* Cached modes MUST be versioned, audited, and constrained by the same guardrails as live proposals.
* Mode cache eviction policy MUST be explicit (LRU, TTL, or capacity-based).

---

### Tier Ω Scope (Applies to Sections 20–29)

Sections **12–21** govern **Tier Ω (Experimental)** features only.

Tier 1 (Production) behavior **must** continue to satisfy all Core Principles in:

* **Section II.1–11** (Pipeline integrity, determinism, contracts, privacy, boundedness),
* **Section VIII** (Performance & Hot-Path Invariants),
* **Section IX** (Observability & Telemetry Contracts), and
* **Section X** (Data Governance & Retention),

regardless of any Tier Ω configuration. **No Tier Ω behavior may weaken or bypass those invariants.**

---

### 12. Bounded Emergence (Tier Ω Only)

We consciously work only inside the **Engineerable Sub-Space**.

* **Tier Ω Only:** Even in experimental regimes, we serve systems where we retain control (budget, timeouts, caps).
* **Chaos Ban (Default):** Highly chaotic or poorly characterized regimes are considered *out of scope* for production claims and live only in research sandboxes.
* **Core Invariant Link:** All Tier Ω work remains subject to Determinism (II.2), Privacy (II.6), Safety (II.7–8), and Boundedness (VIII.1–2).

### 13. Temporal Sovereignty (Tier Ω Only)

**Time-varying structure** (adaptive schedules, time-to-target controllers) is a first-class control mechanism.

* **Dynamic Schedules:** We assume control can be restored through well-designed temporal programs, not just static settings.

### 14. Mathematical Rigor (Algebraic Preference, Tier Ω Only)

* **Solvers over Heuristics:** If a problem can be solved by a matrix operation or algebraic solver, do not use a neural net or heuristic.
* **Explicit Control:** Controllers must be explicit and observable. Hidden control loops are forbidden.
* **Structured Sampling:** Prefer deterministic low-discrepancy / structured grids over naive random sweeps for discovery loops.

### 15. The Omega Tier (Risk Classification, Tier Ω Only)

Strategies are classified by risk profile:

* **Tier 1 (Production):** Safe, bounded, and deterministic for benchmark claims.
* **Tier Ω (Experimental):** Permitted to explore complex behavior but must be strictly confined and never become default by accident.

### 16. Diagnostic Segregation (Tier Ω Only)

* **Signals vs Decisions:** Outputs from Ω-tier probes are treated as **Diagnostic Signals**, not direct decision-makers in production defaults.

### 17. The 4-Layer Hierarchy (Tier Ω Only)

Complex systems follow the standard **Substrate → Observer → Controller → Architect** hierarchy.

* **Explicit Roles:** Components must implicitly or explicitly fulfill one of these roles.
* **Recursive Operators:** Recursive strategies must explicitly declare recursion depth limits and halt conditions.
* **Meta-Optimizers:** Meta-optimizers whose output is the configuration of other optimizers are subject to strict evidence and safety gates.

### 18. Probability Engines (Tier Ω Only)

The system may support probability-shaping engines where outputs are distributions, not scalars.

* **Superposition:** Decisions may be probabilistic until explicitly collapsed by a deterministic selection rule.

### 19. Temporal Physics (Tier Ω Only)

* **Phased Operation:** Systems may explicitly declare phases (e.g., `[
  "probe",
  "classify",
  "refine"
]`). Control policies must adapt to the active phase.

### 20. The Reality Factory (Tier Ω Only)

The system may manage governed experiment namespaces (“Realities”) as first-class lifecycle objects.

* **Lifecycle States:** Experiments must track lifecycle state (`Draft` → `Running` → `Promoted` → `Archived`) with explicit transition gates.

### 21. Strong Emergence Patterns (Tier Ω Only)

* **Homeostatic Override:** Controllers must have the authority to force reset when error thresholds are breached.
* **Curiosity Metrics:** “Surprise” is a valid optimization signal for discovery-only operators.

---

# III. Code Quality & Engineering Standards

### 1. The "Boring Code" Manifesto

We value clarity over cleverness. ArqonShip must be readable by a junior engineer at 3 AM.

* **Readability First:** If a "clever" one-liner creates cognitive load, expand it.
* **Explicit over Implicit:** Magic behavior, monkey-patching, and hidden control flow are forbidden.
* **Standard Tooling:** We adhere strictly to community standards (formatters, linters, type checkers).

### 2. Asynchronous Boundaries

If concurrency/parallel evaluation exists, it must not destroy determinism.

* **Purity Mandate:** Core decision logic must remain synchronous and pure where possible.
* **Timeout Mandate:** No external call (objective, subprocess, IO) shall exist without a configured timeout.

### 3. Error Handling Philosophy

Errors are data, not exceptions. They must be handled explicitly.

* **Fail Loud (Developer Errors):** Logic errors and invariant violations must crash or hard-fail immediately.
* **Fail Soft (Runtime Errors):** External failures must be handled via explicit rejection or controlled degradation.
* **The "Swallow" Ban:** Silent discard of errors is forbidden.

### 4. Logging & Observability

* **Structured Only:** Logs must be structured and include correlation identifiers (e.g., `run_id`).
* **Level Discipline:** `ERROR` means operator intervention is required. `WARN` means handled anomaly. `INFO` is lifecycle.
* **Security Redaction:** Logs must never contain sensitive objective payloads at `INFO` or above.

### 5. Configuration Discipline

* **Config Over Code:** Operational thresholds (timeouts, budgets, caps) must be configurable, not magic numbers.
* **Validation on Startup:** Invalid configuration must fail fast with explicit errors.

### 6. Deterministic State & Contract Correctness

Optimization systems die when state becomes ambiguous.

* **State Machine Contracts:** Phase transitions and mode decisions must be explicit.
* **Determinism:** Same seed + same env + same objective → same decisions and results (within defined tolerances).
* **Artifact Contracts:** Artifact schema is a compatibility surface.

### 7. Contract-First Definition

* Typed config and artifact schemas are the source of truth.
* Untyped ad-hoc dictionaries/maps in core paths are prohibited.

### 8. Memory Safety & Resource Guarantees

* **Resource Caps:** Every subsystem must define caps for memory, retries, and timeouts.

### 9. Concurrency Safety & Ordering

* **Ordering Invariants:** The solver must never assume ordering unless it enforces it.

### 10. Performance Discipline

* **Hot Path Hygiene:** Avoid unnecessary allocations and logging inside per-eval loops.
* **Latency Budgets:** If a latency budget exists (time-to-target), it must be measured and guarded.

### 11. API & Interface Stability

* **Boundary Contracts:** Internal modules communicate via stable interfaces.

### 12. Dependency Hygiene

* **Admission Rules:** New dependencies are guilty until proven innocent.
* **Pinning:** Benchmark-critical dependencies must be version-pinned.

### 13. Documentation Standards

* **Docs as Code:** Documentation must live in the repo.
* **Decision Records:** Significant decisions must be captured (ADR or equivalent).

### 14. Build & Artifact Integrity

* **Reproducibility:** Builds and benchmark runs must be reproducible.
* **Binary/Package Hygiene:** Produced artifacts must be traceable to a commit and environment.

### 15. Mathematical Rigor (Algebraic Preference)

* **Solvers over Heuristics:** Prefer explicit solvers where applicable.
* **Explicit Control:** Hidden control loops are forbidden.
* **Structured Sampling:** Prefer deterministic sampling schemes where it improves time-to-target and reproducibility.

---

# IV. Testing Strategy & Quality Gates

### 1. TDD as the Working Standard

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is the **default and expected workflow** for all ArqonShip components.

* **The Workflow:**
  1. **Specify:** Define behavior in `/specs/` (SDD-first).
  2. **Test:** Write or extend tests that express that behavior.
  3. **Implement:** Write the code that satisfies the tests.
  4. **Refactor:** Optimize while keeping the suite green.

### 2. Coverage Expectations (Per Subsystem)

Coverage is about behavioral exhaustiveness, not raw percentages.

* **Solver Core:** Must cover probe, classify, mode select, refine, and budget accounting.
* **Artifact Layer:** Must cover schema versioning, determinism, replay-critical fields.
* **Benchmark Harness:** Must cover time-to-target measurement and reporting.

### 3. Test Discipline Requirements

* **Unit Tests:** Must run fast with zero external services.
* **Integration Tests:** Must run end-to-end with real dependencies where relevant.
* **Flaky Tests:** Flaky tests are **Critical Bugs**.
* **Determinism:** Tests must avoid random sleeps and time-dependent logic; use controlled clocks.

### 4. Quality Gates

A PR **may not be merged** if any of the following are true:

* **Determinism Gate:** nondeterministic behavior without explicit labeling and tests.
* **Evidence Gate:** benchmark/perf claims without reproducible evidence.
* **Artifact Gate:** schema changes without versioning and compatibility notes.
* **Spec Gate:** behavior implemented without a Spec, or Spec not updated to match Code.
* **Technical Debt Gate:** new `TODO`s without `TD-###` and TTL.

### 5. Probe Guardrail Tests

Probe changes require passing the following mandatory test classes:

| Test Class | Requirement |
|:---|:---|
| `TestProbeOnlyQuality` | New probe beats legacy on shifted instances. |
| `TestStructuredRouting` | NM wins on structured landscapes (mode selection). |
| `TestMultimodalGuardrail` | Probe is robust on Rastrigin-class objectives. |
| `TestGeometryRegression` | Probe geometry is deterministic and reproducible. |
| `TestStructuredNMCorrectness` | NM periodic arithmetic is correct. |
| `TestTimeToQuality` | Time-to-target metrics are computed and reported. |

Reference implementation: `benchmarks/test_probe_guardrails.py`

---

# V. Lifecycle & Automation

ArqonShip does not “ship code”; it manufactures **artifacts** through a controlled factory.

### 1. The Factory Mandate

Manual releases are forbidden for production claims. CI is the source of truth.

* **The Pipeline is Sovereign:** If it did not pass CI, it does not exist.

### 2. Immutable & Reproducible Artifacts

* **Immutable Artifacts:** Release artifacts must be identifiable by content hash.
* **Reproducible Builds:** The same commit must build reproducibly in the canonical environment.

### 3. Supply Chain Security

* **Dependency Locking:** No floating versions for benchmark-critical paths.
* **Provenance:** Artifact origin must be traceable (commit, branch, CI run).

---

# VI. Operational Excellence

ArqonShip is correctness-sensitive infrastructure for optimization. The way it behaves under real objectives is as important as the way it behaves in tests.

### 1. Performance & Capacity Invariants

* **Boundedness:** No unbounded loops. Budget and timeouts are mandatory.
* **Overhead Discipline:** Policy updates and bookkeeping must remain bounded and low overhead.

### 2. Observability & Audit

* **Reconstructability:** Logs + artifacts must allow reconstruction of what happened in a run.
* **No Silent Recovery:** Any fallback must be visible and test-covered.

---

# VII. Governance & Amendment

Governance defines how ArqonShip protects its mission and how this Constitution itself may change.

### 1. Scope Protection

ArqonShip is probe-gated optimization for the two target use cases. Scope creep is a bug.

### 2. Complexity Budget

Complexity is technical debt with compound interest.

* Adding major dependencies or new execution modes requires explicit review and an ADR.

### 3. Amendments

This Constitution is living but intentionally hard to change.

* Amendments require a documented proposal (rationale + impact) and a version bump.

---

# VIII. Performance & Hot-Path Invariants

Performance is not an optimization; it is a **correctness property**.

### 1. Boundedness as Law

Unbounded anything is a denial-of-service vector.

* **No Unbounded Work:** Every loop must have a budget.
* **CPU Boundaries:** Heavy work must not block the per-eval control loop without explicit design.

### 2. Hot-Path Constraints

* **O(1) or Amortized O(1):** Per-eval policy decisions must be O(1) or amortized O(1).
* **No Hidden I/O:** Do not write artifacts inside the inner loop unless explicitly buffered.

### 3. Hot-Path Parameter Representation & Determinism (v1.4.1, merge-blocking)

This section defines non-negotiable architectural invariants for parameter storage in Tier-1/Tier-2 hot paths. Violations are merge blockers.

**Hot Path Definition (Normative):**
"Hot Path" means any code executing inside the Tier-2 decision window or Tier-1 apply window, specifically: all functions and their transitive callees executed during:
1. `T2_decision_us` (start: digest popped → end: proposal emitted)
2. `T1_apply_us` (start: proposal received → end: in-memory config swap completed)

Hot Path includes: Tier-2 observe/decision loop, SPSA step math, guardrail validation, delta application, atomic swap, telemetry ingest, audit enqueue (non-blocking), and any per-tick scheduling within these windows.

#### A. Hot-Path Disallowed Types (Merge-Blocking)

In Hot Path code, the following are **FORBIDDEN**:
* `std::collections::HashMap`
* `hashbrown::HashMap`
* Any map/dictionary keyed by strings (or heap-owned identifiers) used to store parameters or deltas.

**Reason:** Hot Path must use dense indexed representations (`ParamVec`/`DeltaVec`) for determinism, locality, and zero-allocation guarantees.

#### B. Hot-Path Representation Rule (Required)

Tier-1 and Tier-2 parameter values and deltas MUST be represented as:
* **ParamVec** = dense ordered numeric vector (`SmallVec<[f64; N]>` or `Vec<f64>`)
* **DeltaVec** = same dense ordered numeric vector type.

Tier-1/Tier-2 public APIs MUST NOT accept or return named-parameter maps.

#### C. No Escape Hatches (Merge-Blocking)

In Hot Path modules/crates:
* `#[allow(clippy::disallowed_types)]` is **FORBIDDEN**.
* Any allow/override of the Hot Path disallowed-type rules is **FORBIDDEN**.

**Exception:** Boundary modules only (CLI/IO/artifact serialization) may use named maps, but must never be linked into Hot Path timing windows.

#### D. Enforcement Requirements (CI Merge-Blocking)

CI MUST enforce Hot Path type constraints using:
* `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
* `#![deny(clippy::disallowed_types)]` in the Hot Path crate/module root
* `clippy.toml` specifying disallowed types, at minimum:
  * `std::collections::HashMap`
  * `hashbrown::HashMap`

Any violation is a **MERGE BLOCKER**.

#### E. Constructor/API Rule (Required)

All Tier-1/Tier-2 constructors and runtime methods MUST accept only dense types:
* Engine initialization MUST accept `(ParamRegistry, ParamVec)` (or a single struct containing them).
* Hot Path runtime loops MUST NOT accept `NamedParams` or any `HashMap<String, _>` type (directly or indirectly).
* All boundary conversion from named→dense MUST occur **once** at initialization or boundary serialization only.

#### F. ParamRegistry Contract (Required for Audit + Replay)

* **Existence REQUIRED:** A `ParamRegistry` (or equivalent) MUST exist to provide:
  * Stable mapping: `name ↔ id/index`
  * Deterministic ordering (consistent across runs with same schema)
  * Schema/version identity
* **Immutability REQUIRED:** The mapping MUST be immutable during a run for Tier-1/Tier-2 operation.

#### G. Deterministic Replay Artifact Contract (Required)

Artifacts MUST include the following fields (**exact keys**):
* `seed`: `u64`
* `registry_hash64`: `u64`
* `registry_names`: `[String]` (stable ordered list)
* `param_len`: `usize`
* `params_vec`: `[f64]` (dense ordered values)

*Optional (derived for readability only)*:
* `params_named`: `{ String: f64 }`

**Rule:** `params_named` MUST be derivable from `registry_names` + `params_vec` and MUST NOT be required for replay. Replay MUST NOT require string hashing to reconstruct the decision path.

#### H. Tier Ω Exception Policy (Explicitly Bounded)

* **Sandbox Exploration Allowed:** Tier Ω (experimental) MAY explore dynamic parameter sets.
* **Production Invariants Preserved:** Tier-1/Tier-2 invariants remain non-bypassable even when Tier Ω is active.
* **Promotion Gate:** Promotion from Tier Ω to production REQUIRES passing all hot-path invariant tests and freezing a registry.

#### I. Performance Enforcement (Merge/Ship Blockers)

* **No-Alloc Test REQUIRED:** CI MUST include a "no-alloc hot path" test for Tier-1 apply and Tier-2 observe/decision paths (release mode).
  * `observe()` allocs == 0
  * `apply()` allocs == 0
* **Benchmark Gate REQUIRED:** CI MUST include a benchmark regression gate for `T2_decision_us` and `T1_apply_us` (release mode) consistent with VIII.5 timing budgets.
* **Budgets Checked:** Budgets are checked in release mode and FAIL CI if exceeded.

**Evidence Requirement:**
* Any latency claim MUST attach evidence (Observed) including: build mode, CPU model, benchmark method, and p50/p99/max.
* Allocation claims MUST be measured (Observed via instrumentation or allocator hook) or the claim is false.

### 4. Time-to-Target Metrics

The canonical quality-time tradeoff measurements are:

* **Evals-to-Threshold:** Number of evaluations to first reach a target quality threshold.
* **Hit-by-N:** Binary success metric—did the run reach threshold within N evals?
* **Median-Best-at-Horizon:** Median of best-seen value at a fixed eval count across seeds.

These metrics MUST be reported per-objective in benchmark artifacts.

### 5. Timing Window Contracts

For microsecond-latency operation, the following timing windows are canonical:

| Timing Window | Definition | Typical Budget |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `T2_decision_us` | Digest popped from ring buffer → proposal emitted by Tier 2 | ≤1,000 µs |
| `T1_apply_us` | Proposal received by Tier 1 → guardrails validated + atomic swap completed | ≤100 µs |
| `E2E_visible_us` | Digest available → dataplane observes new config | ≤2,000 µs |

**Measurement Requirements:**
* Latency claims MUST specify: build mode (debug/release), hardware (CPU model, memory), and measurement method (wall clock, flamegraph, tracing).
* Benchmarks MUST include p50, p99, and max latencies.
* Regression guards MUST exist for all timing budgets (CI fails if exceeded).

### 6. Hot Path Non-Blocking Audit

Audit-to-disk MUST be explicitly decoupled from the critical path.

* **Ring Buffer / Async Writer:** Audit events are pushed to a lock-free ring buffer; a background thread persists to disk.
* **No Blocking I/O:** Disk I/O (file writes, network calls) is FORBIDDEN in the apply critical path.
* **Overflow Policy:** If the ring buffer is full, the overflow policy MUST be explicit (drop oldest, block, or signal backpressure).

### 7. Zero-Allocation Critical Path

The critical path (`T1_apply_us` window) MUST remain zero-allocation:

* **No Heap Allocations:** Use pre-allocated buffers, arena allocators, or stack allocation.
* **No Blocking Syscalls:** No `malloc`, `mmap`, file I/O, or network I/O.
* **Arc Clone Only:** `snapshot()` operations use cheap Arc clone, not deep copy.

---

# IX. Observability & Telemetry Contracts

What cannot be observed cannot be governed.

### 1. Logs, Metrics, Traces as First-Class Citizens

* **Structured Logs Only:** Must include `run_id` and phase markers.
* **Telemetry for Mode Decisions:** Mode selection and classification results must be observable.

### 2. Structured Events & Correlation IDs

For the Adaptive Engine control loop, the following event types are REQUIRED:

| Event Type | Trigger | Required Fields |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `digest` | New telemetry digest pushed | `run_id`, `timestamp_us`, `digest_id`, `objective_value` |
| `proposal` | Tier 2 emits a proposal | `run_id`, `proposal_id`, `config_version`, `delta_summary` |
| `apply` | Tier 1 successfully applies config | `run_id`, `proposal_id`, `new_config_version`, `apply_latency_us` |
| `rollback` | Tier 1 triggers rollback | `run_id`, `proposal_id`, `rollback_reason`, `reverted_to_version` |
| `promotion` | Variant promoted to Approved/Promoted | `run_id`, `variant_id`, `old_state`, `new_state`, `evidence_ref` |

**Correlation ID Requirements:**
* All events in a single adaptation cycle MUST share the same `run_id`.
* Proposals MUST have unique `proposal_id` for traceability.
* Config versions MUST use monotonic `config_version` counters.

---

# X. Data Governance & Retention

ArqonShip may handle sensitive objective data. Data is an asset and a liability.

### 1. Data Classification

* **Run Artifacts:** schema-versioned run outputs.
* **Objective Data:** treated as sensitive by default.

### 2. Retention

* **Explicit Retention:** No infinite retention by accident; retention policies must be explicit.

---

# XI. Internal Service Contracts & Complexity Escalation

The internal structure must remain understandable, evolvable, and safe.

### 1. Internal Contracts

* **Versioned Contracts:** Internal boundaries must have explicit, versioned contracts (types + schemas).

### 2. Complexity Budget & Escalation

* Introducing a new core dependency or major execution mode requires a design review document and ADR.

### 3. Benchmark Schema Contract

Benchmark artifacts MUST follow a declarative schema:

* **Objective Suite (minimum):** sphere_smooth_shift, rosenbrock_smooth_shift, rastrigin_torus.
* **Cost Regimes:** cheap (1ms), expensive (20ms+).
* **Output Schema:** CSV with columns [run_id, eval_id, best_so_far, elapsed_ms, params].
* **Plots:** best_vs_time.png, cdf_time_to_threshold.png per objective.

### 4. SDK Binding Compliance

Python bindings MUST maintain parity with Rust core:

* **Determinism Parity:** `ArqonProbe` and `ArqonSolver` (Python) MUST produce identical results to Rust core for same (seed, config).
* **Sharding Verification:** Bitwise hash of sorted samples MUST match single-worker vs multi-worker configurations.
* **Binding Changes:** Require parity tests in CI before merge.

### 5. Strategy Parameter Governance

Strategy parameters require explicit governance:

* **K (parallel starts):** MUST have documented default and rationale.
* **Triage Budget:** MUST be bounded; unbounded triage is forbidden.
* **Stall Threshold:** MUST trigger rotation; silent stalling is forbidden.
* **Spice Ratio:** MUST be configurable with documented default (10%).

Changes to defaults require an ADR with benchmark evidence.

# XII. Glossary & Canonical Definitions

To prevent interpretation drift (especially for Spec Kit agents), we define core vocabulary used throughout this Constitution.

# XIV. ULTIMATE INTEGRITY ATTESTATION & EVIDENCE PACK

This section is the **merge/ship gate**. It exists so “done” is not a feeling—it is a reproducible fact.

---

### 1) Merge/Ship Attestation (Required)

By merging or shipping, the author(s) and reviewer(s) attest:

- No placeholders exist in production paths (no TODOs, stubs, pseudocode-as-work, “later hardening”).
- No fake evidence is presented (no invented logs, benchmarks, screenshots, coverage, or results).
- No happy-path-only verification exists for critical behaviors.
- No silent failure handling exists; errors are handled/logged/propagated with context.
- Warnings were treated as errors (clean lint/typecheck/compile).
- Any technical debt is recorded as `TD-###` with owner + TTL + exit criteria and is bounded by tests.
- All claims are labeled Observed/Derived/Unverified, and Observed claims have attached evidence.

If you cannot honestly attest to every item above, you must not merge/ship.

---

### 2) Evidence Pack (Attach or Link; Required)

A change is invalid without a reproducible Evidence Pack. The Evidence Pack must be tied to a specific commit and must be reproducible by another engineer.

#### 2.1 Build Proof
- CI run or local output showing:
  - clean build,
  - clean lint/typecheck/format,
  - warnings treated as errors.

#### 2.2 Test Proof
- Results for:
  - unit tests,
  - integration tests (where applicable),
  - property/fuzz tests (where required by input boundaries),
  - concurrency/ordering tests (where applicable).
- A short note listing what is not covered and why (explicitly, not implicitly).

#### 2.3 Failure Matrix Proof (Where the bad paths live)
For each externally coupled feature, list:
- failure scenarios tested (timeouts, retries, malformed responses, permission failures, overload/backpressure, partial failures),
- test file(s) and test names (or equivalent pointers).

#### 2.4 Traceability Proof (Truth Table)
Provide a “truth table” mapping:
- requirement / acceptance criteria → implementation location(s) → test location(s) → documentation location(s) → evidence artifact(s).

Rule: If a requirement has no test, it is untested. If a test has no requirement, it is suspicious.

#### 2.5 Runtime Proof (When Applicable)
- example run logs demonstrating:
  - normal behavior,
  - at least one failure mode behaving correctly.
- proof of observability works:
  - correlation IDs exist,
  - metrics/traces exist (or equivalent breadcrumbs).

#### 2.6 Performance / Resource Proof (When Relevant)
- baseline numbers + method + environment,
- a regression guard (benchmark test, threshold check, or documented budget),
- proof of bounded behavior (caps, backpressure, shedding policy).

#### 2.7 Reproduction Commands
- one-command verification (examples):
  - `pytest`, `python -m build`, etc.
- environment notes:
  - pinned toolchains/dependencies,
  - seed control for deterministic tests.

### 2.8 Canonical Environment Mandate

To ensure absolute reproducibility, all development and CI operations MUST use the canonical Conda environment: `helios-gpu-118`.

**Paths:**
- Python: `/home/irbsurfer/miniconda3/envs/helios-gpu-118/bin/python`
- Cargo: `/home/irbsurfer/miniconda3/envs/helios-gpu-118/bin/cargo`

**Rules:**
- Do NOT rely on system `python` or `cargo`.
- Scripts and tools MUST resolve these absolute paths or explicitly activate the environment.

---

### 3) Debt Register Enforcement (TD-###)

If any `TD-###` exists in the change:
- TTL date and owner are mandatory.
- The debt boundary must be protected by tests so it cannot silently expand.
- The exit criteria must be concrete.
- Debt past TTL is a release/merge blocker.

---

### 4) Professional Review Checklist (Hard Questions Only)

Review must answer “yes” with evidence:

- Does this handle failure modes explicitly (not “assumed”)?
- Are tests realistic, adversarial, and non-trivial (no lazy synthetics)?
- Are there concurrency/ordering hazards, and are they tested or explicitly ruled out?
- Is behavior observable (logs/metrics/traces/breadcrumbs)?
- Are resource bounds explicit (timeouts, caps, retry budgets, queue bounds)?
- Is the code readable under pressure (3 AM standard)?
- Is documentation updated to match behavior and constraints?
- Can another engineer reproduce the Evidence Pack from scratch?

If any answer is “no,” the change is not complete.

---

### 5) Claim Ledger Summary (Required When Stating Status)

If a deliverable claims completion or correctness, it must include:

- Observed claims: link evidence
- Derived claims: list assumptions + risks + how to verify
- Unverified claims: list the minimal experiment to verify

Rule: If it cannot be reproduced from the Evidence Pack, it is not true.  
Rule: If it is not true, it is not done.

---

# V. Naming, Positioning & Brand Constitution

This section defines the **non-negotiable** nomenclature and positioning hierarchy for the project. These rules apply to all documentation, website copy, repository descriptions, and marketing materials.

### 1. The Hierarchy Implementation

The Arqon stack is always presented in this specific order of authority:

| Level | Canonical Term | Usage Scope |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Company** | **Arqon Tech** | Organization, copyright, legal, "Built by..." credits |
| **Product** | **Arqon Runtime Optimizer** | The User-Facing Product, the Website, the Solution |
| **Category** | **Runtime Optimization Infrastructure** | The functional category we own (genericized) |
| **Engine** | **ArqonShip** | The internal Rust core, the algorithm, the technical "powered by" component |

### 2. Mandatory Rules

#### Rule 1: Product vs. Engine Separation
*   **The Product is "Arqon Runtime Optimizer"**. This is the title of the website, the H1 of the home page, and how we refer to the solution in sales/marketing contexts.
*   **The Engine is "ArqonShip"**. This refers *strictly* to the underlying technical artifacts (crates, algorithms, inner loops).
    *   *Correct:* "Arqon Runtime Optimizer is powered by the sub-microsecond ArqonShip engine."
    *   *Incorrect:* "Download ArqonShip to optimize your cloud." (User downloads the Product, which contains the Engine).

#### Rule 2: Title Case Branding
*   **Arqon Runtime Optimizer** is a proper noun. Always Title Case.
*   **ArqonShip** is a proper noun / code identifier. Always CamelCase with "HPO".
*   "Runtime optimization" (the activity) is lowercase unless part of the formal Category name.

#### Rule 3: Category Ownership
*   We do not brand the category as "Arqon Optimization". We use the generic **Runtime Optimization Infrastructure** to establish the standard.
*   *Why?* We want to own the generic term "Runtime Optimization" in the user's mind, just as "Search" or "Databases" are categories.

#### Rule 4: Stack Presentation Order
When introducing the project, follow: **Company → Product → Category → Engine**.
*   *Example:* "Arqon Tech presents Arqon Runtime Optimizer, the first Runtime Optimization Infrastructure powered by the ArqonShip engine."

### 3. Copy & Positioning Standards

#### Headline Standards
*   **H1**: Arqon Runtime Optimizer
*   **Subhead**: "Runtime optimization infrastructure for live production systems."
*   **Support**: "Deterministic, guardrailed, sub-microsecond control loops—powered by ArqonShip."

#### Glossary & Do/Don't

| Term | Definition | Do | Don't |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Arqon Tech** | The company/entity. | "Copyright 2025 Arqon Tech" | "Copyright ArqonShip" |
| **Arqon Runtime Optimizer** | The commercial/downloadable product. | "Install Arqon Runtime Optimizer" | "Install ArqonShip" (unless specifically referring to the crate) |
| **Runtime Optimization** | The activity/category. | "The leader in Runtime Optimization" | "The leader in Hyperparameter Tuning" (too offline) |
| **ArqonShip** | The Rust core engine. | "Powered by ArqonShip" | "Arqon HPO" (space), "ArqonShip" (unless code) |

### 4. Migration Note
*   The crate name remains `ArqonShip` in `Cargo.toml` and PyPI for limits of identifier stability.
*   The documentation site title moves to **Arqon Runtime Optimizer**.
*   The repo name may remain `ArqonShip` or move to `arqon-runtime-optimizer` at discretion of Ops, but the *public name* is migrated.

---

## Implementation Substrate & SDK Contract
- Core implementation MUST be a Rust library crate exposing the probe-gated solver API.
- CLI MUST be a thin Rust binary crate that delegates to the core.
- SDKs (for example, Python) MUST be thin bindings over the same core, not reimplementing solver logic.
- Artifacts MUST be language-agnostic (JSON) and serve as the compatibility contract between surfaces.

**Version**: 1.6.0  
**Ratified**: 2025-12-17  
**Last Amended**: 2025-12-19

# XVI. Codebase Oracle Principles (ArqonShip)

 Governance for the `arqon scan` and indexing subsystem.

### 1. Graph Determinism
- **Immutability:** AST parsing (Tree-sitter) must be deterministic. The same codebase state must ALWAYS produce the exact same graph structure and edge set.
- **Reproducibility:** Embeddings generation must use pinned model versions. Randomness in embeddings (e.g. dropout during inference) is forbidden.
- **Verification:** `arqon scan --verify` must hash the generated graph and match against the artifact hash.

### 2. Schema Stability
- The `.arqon/graph.json` schema is a **public compatibility surface**.
- Changes to `GraphNode` or `GraphEdge` structures require semantic versioning.
- Breaking schema changes require a MAJOR version bump of the ArqonShip CLI.
- All artifacts must include a schema version header.

### 3. Privacy & Local-First
- **Zero Data Leakage:** All indexing, parsing, and embedding happens LOCALLY.
- **No Cloud APIs:** It is strictly forbidden for the default configuration to contact external LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic) for indexing.
- **Embeddings:** Must be generated with local models (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` via `ollama` or `rust-bert`).

### 4. Incremental Scan Safety
- **Atomic Updates:** Partial scans must not corrupt the graph state.
- **Rollback:** If a scan fails mid-update, the `.arqon/` directory must revert to the previous valid state.
- **Corruption Detection:** The system must detect corrupted artifacts on startup and trigger a full rebuild.

# XVII. Self-Healing CI Principles (ArqonShip)

Safety rails for the `arqon heal` autonomous repair features.

### 1. LLM Governance
- **Versioned Prompts:** All prompts used for code generation must be version-controlled in the repo.
- **Pinned Models:** The system must use specific, pinned model versions (e.g., `deepseek-coder:1.3b-Q4_K_M`) to ensure consistent behavior.
- **Testing:** Prompt templates must include concrete examples in the test suite.

### 2. Healing Safety Guardrails
- **Attempt Limits:** Max 2 healing attempts per CI run. Infinite loops are strictly forbidden.
- **Validation Gates:** Generated code must pass: 
    1. Syntax check
    2. Lint check (`cargo clippy`, `ruff`)
    3. The original failing test
- **Fail Closed:** If the repair logic fails or the 2 attempts are exhausted, the CI job fails explicitly. Silent fallbacks are forbidden.

### 3. Security Constraints
- **Structured Feed:** Only feed structured error data to the LLM (file, line, error message).
- **No Raw Test Output:** Raw `stdout`/`stderr` from user tests MUST NOT be fed directly to the LLM prompt to prevent prompt injection/jailbreaking via malicious test output.
- **Scope Limits:** The LLM is forbidden from modifying CI configuration files (`.github/workflows`), secret files, or version manifests.

### 4. Evidence Requirements
- **Audit Trails:** Every healing attempt must log the input prompt, the raw LLM output, and the validation result.
- **Artifacts:** Healing logs must be preserved as CI artifacts for post-mortem analysis.

# XVIII. CI/CD Automation Principles (ArqonShip)

Integrity rules for the fully automated pipeline.

### 1. GitHub Actions Integrity
- **Mandatory Checks:** Automated operations (`arqon ship`, self-healing) must run ALL required checks.
- **No Bypasses:** The use of `[skip ci]` or bypass flags by the automation is forbidden unless strictly scoped to documentation-only updates.
- **Token Scope:** The `GITHUB_TOKEN` used by ArqonShip must have the minimal necessary scopes (read repo, contents; write PRs).

### 2. Auto-Merge Safety
- **Green CI Mandatory:** Auto-merge is only permitted if the CI suite is fully passing.
- **Label Gating:** Auto-merge must respect `do-not-merge`, `wip`, or `blocked` labels.
- **Opt-In:** Auto-merge must be an explicit opt-in preference, not the default.
- **Failure Notification:** If auto-merge fails, the system must notify the user (via PR comment), not retry silently.

### 3. Rate Limiting & Quotas
- **API Citizenship:** `arqon ship` must implement exponential backoff for all GitHub API calls.
- **Quota Management:** The system must enforce a rate limit (e.g., max 10 PR status polls per minute) to prevent exhausting the user's API quota.

# XIX. ArqonShip CLI Contracts

Stability guarantees for the developer tools.

### 1. Command Stability
- **Public API:** The CLI commands (`init`, `scan`, `chat`, `verify`, `ship`, `heal`) and their flags are the public API.
- **SemVer Compliance:** Renaming or removing command flags requires a MAJOR version bump.
- **Deprecation Policy:** Deprecated commands must show warnings for at least 1 MINOR version before removal.

### 2. Configuration Contract
- **Schema Versioning:** The `.arqon/config.toml` file must be versioned.
- **Fail Fast:** Invalid configuration must cause the CLI to exit immediately with a helpful error message.
- **Automated Migration:** Breaking config changes must be accompanied by an `arqon migrate-config` capability.

### 3. Artifact Lifecycle
- **Freshness:** `.arqon/graph.json` must be updated on every `arqon scan`.
- **Garbage Collection:** `.arqon/vectors.lance/` must have a configurable GC policy (e.g., delete vectors older than 30 days) to prevent unrestricted disk usage growth.
- **Metadata:** All generated artifacts must include: schema version, creation timestamp, and ArqonShip version.

# XX. The Supreme Court (Governance)

Strict enforcement mechanisms for the Autonomous Fleet.

### 1. The Justice Agent
- **Role:** The ruthless gatekeeper. Checks every PR before human review.
- **Mandate:** "Reject first, ask questions later." If a PR violates *any* article, it is blocked.
- **Bribe Resistance:** The Justice Agent must be tested against adversarial attempts to bypass rules (e.g., "Ignore this error").

### 2. The Quality Mandate (Strict)
- **No Secrets:** Hardcoded credentials/tokens are forbidden.
- **Complexity Cap:** 
    - Function > 50 lines = BLOCK.
    - File > 500 lines = BLOCK.
- **Coverage:** No PR may decrease test coverage.

**Version**: 2.0.0 (ArqonShip)
**Ratified**: 2025-12-20
