## 1. Claim & Hypothesis
<!--
  What does this product do?
  What is the core hypothesis?
-->
- **Claim**: [e.g., This optimizer reduces training time by 20%]
- **Hypothesis**: [e.g., If we use logic X, metric Y improves by Z]
- **Confidence**: [Low/Medium/High] - **Falsification**: [What result proves us wrong?]
